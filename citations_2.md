Paper 0: [The molecular pathogenesis of colorectal cancer and its potential application to colorectal cancer screening](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10620-014-3444-4) (2015, 262 cites)
 Abstract: Advances in our understanding of the molecular genetics and epigenetics of colorectal cancer have led to novel insights into the pathogenesis of this common cancer. These advances have revealed that there are molecular subtypes of colon polyps and colon cancer and that these molecular subclasses have unique and discrete clinical and pathological features. Although the molecular characterization of these subgroups of colorectal polyps and cancer is only partially understood at this time, it does appear likely that classifying colon polyps and cancers based on their genomic instability and/or epigenomic instability status will eventually be useful for informing approaches for the prevention and early detection of colon polyps and colorectal cancer.

In this review, we will discuss our current understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of the polyp to cancer sequence and the potential to use this information to direct screening and prevention programs.
 

Paper 1: [High‐performance thermoelectric SnSe: aqueous synthesis, innovations, and challenges](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/advs.201902923) (2020, 202 cites)
 Abstract: Tin selenide (SnSe) is one of the most promising candidates to realize environmentally friendly, cost-effective, and high-performance thermoelectrics, derived from its outstanding electrical transport properties by appropriate bandgaps and intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity from its anharmonic layered structure. Advanced aqueous synthesis possesses various unique advantages including convenient morphology control, exceptional high doping solubility, and distinctive vacancy engineering. Considering that there is an urgent demand for a comprehensive survey on the aqueous synthesis technique applied to thermoelectric SnSe, herein, a thorough overview of aqueous synthesis, characterization, and thermoelectric performance in SnSe is provided. New insights into the aqueous synthesis-based strategies for improving the performance are provided, including vacancy synergy, crystallization design, solubility breakthrough, and local lattice imperfection engineering, and an attempt to build the inherent links between the aqueous synthesis-induced structural characteristics and the excellent thermoelectric performance is presented. Furthermore, the significant advantages and potentials of an aqueous synthesis route for fabricating SnSe-based 2D thermoelectric generators, including nanorods, nanobelts, and nanosheets, are also discussed. Finally, the controversy, strategy, and outlook toward future enhancement of SnSe-based thermoelectric materials are also provided. This Review guides the design of thermoelectric SnSe with high performance and provides new perspectives as a reference for other thermoelectric systems.
 

Paper 2: [Enhancement of monolayer SnSe light absorption by strain engineering: a DFT calculation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301010418312308) (2019, 59 cites)
 Abstract: Strain effects on the electronic and optical properties of monolayer SnSe is studied by APW + lo method in DFT framework. The applied strains cause direct-indirect transition of SnSe band gap which is mainly constructed by s/p hybridization. The armchair εac and zigzag εzz reduce the unstrained band gap of 1.05 eV down to 0 eV at 12% compression, but at 12% tension, the band gap decreases to 0.726–0.804 eV. The band gap always increases under biaxial strain εb at 12% compression to 12% tension. We observe an enhancement of real ε1(ω) and imaginary ε2(ω) parts of dielectric function by 14%–30% of magnitude, wider peak distribution to infrared and ultra-violet regions, and appearance of new peaks in the ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) spectrums. As a consequence, the light absorption α(ω) is significantly enhanced in the ultra-violet region and the absorption even starts at lower energy at infrared region.
 

Paper 3: [Electronic Structure Control of Sub-nanometer 1D SnTe via Nanostructuring within Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsnano.8b02261) (2018, 52 cites)
 Abstract: Nanostructuring, e.g., reduction of dimensionality in materials, offers a viable route toward regulation of materials electronic and hence functional properties. Here, we present the extreme case of nanostructuring, exploiting the capillarity of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) for the synthesis of the smallest possible SnTe nanowires with cross sections as thin as a single atom column. We demonstrate that by choosing the appropriate diameter of a template SWCNT, we can manipulate the structure of the quasi-one-dimensional (1D) SnTe to design electronic behavior. From first principles, we predict the structural re-formations that SnTe undergoes in varying encapsulations and confront the prediction with TEM imagery. To further illustrate the control of physical properties by nanostructuring, we study the evolution of transport properties in a homologous series of models of synthesized and isolated SnTe nanowires varying only in morphology and atomic layer thickness. This extreme scaling is predicted to significantly enhance thermoelectric performance of SnTe, offering a prospect for further experimental studies and future applications.
 

Paper 4: [Unprecedented new crystalline forms of SnSe in narrow to medium diameter carbon nanotubes](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b00133) (2019, 41 cites)
 Abstract: We report the observation of four unprecedented new crystalline forms of SnSe, obtained as a result of encapsulation in narrow to medium diameter single-walled carbon nanotubes. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy at 80 kV revealed linear, zigzag, helical (i.e., 2 × 1) atomic chains and a new form of encapsulated SnSe. This new form is apparently isostructural to free-standing MoS, MoSe, and WSe extreme nanowires etched from the corresponding monolayer dichalcogenides and also recently observed encapsulated MoTe. A structural model has been attained from annular dark-field (ADF) images. The experimental imaging agrees well with image simulations produced from models anticipated for the new structural forms.
 

Paper 5: [Fermi level engineering of metallicity-sorted metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes by encapsulation of few-atom-thick crystals of silver chloride](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10853-018-2575-y) (2018, 28 cites)
 Abstract: In the present work, the channels of metallicity-sorted metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have been filled with silver chloride. The data of high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy proved the filling of the nanotube channels and formation of few-atom-thick crystals of silver chloride. The electronic properties of the filled SWCNTs were investigated by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Our results indicate the p-doping of nanotubes by silver chloride accompanied by the charge transfer from the nanotubes to the encapsulated compound and the downshift of the Fermi level by 0.36 eV. The calculated number of transferred electrons per nanotube carbon atom and the charge transfer density per nanotube length amounted to 0.0024 e− per carbon and 0.0406 e−/Å, respectively. It was found that the band gap opens up in the band structure of the filled SWCNTs resulting in their transition from metallic into a semiconducting state. This work reveals a direct influence of the incorporated silver chloride on the electronic properties of metallicity-sorted metallic SWCNTs and demonstrates the potential of precise Fermi level engineering of SWCNTs by filling their channels and achieving high doping levels, thus providing a platform for designing next-generation nanoelectronic devices.
 

Paper 6: [Encapsulated nanowires: Boosting electronic transport in carbon nanotubes](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.95.121408) (2017, 24 cites)
 Abstract: The electrical conductivity of metallic carbon nanotubes (CNTs) quickly saturates with respect to bias voltage due to scattering from a large population of optical phonons. The decay of these dominant scatterers in pristine CNTs is too slow to offset an increased generation rate at high voltage bias. We demonstrate from first principles that encapsulation of one-dimensional atomic chains within a single-walled CNT can enhance the decay of “hot” phonons by providing additional channels for thermalization. Pacification of the phonon population growth reduces the electrical resistivity of metallic CNTs by 51% for an example system with encapsulated beryllium.
 

Paper 7: [Effect of iodine doping on the electrical, thermal and mechanical properties of SnSe for thermoelectric applications](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/cp/d0cp06130a) (2021, 21 cites)
 Abstract: We report the evolution of the thermoelectric and mechanical properties of n-type SnSe obtained by iodine doping at the Se site. The thermoelectric performance of n-type SnSe is detailed in the temperature range starting from 150 K ≤ _T_ ≤ 700 K. The power factor of 0.25% iodine doped SnSe is found to be 0.33 mW m−1 K−2 at 700 K, comparable to that of the other monovalent doped n-type SnSe. The temperature-dependent electrical conductivity of the undoped and iodine doped SnSe samples is corroborated by using the adiabatic small polaron hopping model. A very low value of thermal conductivity, 0.62 W m−1 K−1, is obtained at 300 K and is comparable to that of SnSe single crystals. The low thermal conductivity of n-type polycrystalline SnSe is understood by taking into account the anharmonic phonon vibrations induced by the incorporation of heavy iodine atoms at the Se sites as well as the structural hierarchy of the compound. Besides, iodine doping is found to improve the reduced Young's modulus and hardness values of SnSe, which is highly desirable for thermoelectric device applications.
 

Paper 8: [Comparative analysis of electronic properties of tin, gallium, and bismuth chalcogenide-filled single-walled carbon nanotubes](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10853-014-8550-3) (2014, 21 cites)
 Abstract: In the present work, the channels of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were filled with tin sulfide (SnS), gallium telluride (GaTe), and bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3). The successful encapsulation of the compounds was proven by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The electronic properties of the filled SWCNTs were studied by optical absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was found that the embedded metal chalcogenides have different influence on the electronic properties of the nanotubes. The incorporation of tin sulfide into the SWCNTs does not result in sufficient changes in the electronic structure of SWCNTs, except for a minor influence on metallic nanotubes. The filling of SWCNTs with gallium telluride causes the charge transfer from the SWCNT walls to the encapsulated compound due to acceptor doping of the nanotubes. The insertion of bismuth selenide inside the SWCNT channels does not lead to the modification of the electronic properties of nanotubes.
 

Paper 9: [Experimental and theoretical studies on the electronic properties of praseodymium chloride-filled single-walled carbon nanotubes](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10853-015-9086-x) (2015, 15 cites)
 Abstract: Praseodymium chloride (PrCl3) was encapsulated into channels of 1.4 nm diameter single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by a capillary filling method. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy data demonstrated a high filling factor of the nanotubes and the formation of one-dimensional (1D) PrCl3 nanocrystals. The optical absorption, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data testified to the filling-induced lowering of the Fermi level of the nanotubes as a result of the electron transfer from the SWCNTs to the embedded PrCl3. The density functional theory modeling showed the absence of local chemical interactions between the nanotubes and the 1D crystals. It was found that the incorporated PrCl3 has stronger influence on the electronic properties of metallic nanotubes than semiconducting SWCNTs.
 

Paper 10: [Vibrational and electronic structures of tin selenide nanowires confined inside carbon nanotubes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0379677921002745) (2022, 14 cites)
 Abstract: We study vibrational and electronic properties of tin selenide (SnSe) nanowires encapsulated in single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) by combining experimental Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) level. The theoretically investigated standalone SnSe nanowires are Sn4Se4 with square (2 × 2) atomic arrangement and Sn6Se6 with a repeating hexagonal Mo6S6-like structure. Raman data support the theoretical prediction that the square (2 × 2) nanowires possess specific modes at 151 and 185 cm−1, whereas the hexagonal Sn6Se6 structure is characterized by a mode appearing at ~ 235 cm−1. Calculations predict that the (2 × 2) nanowire has an electronic gap of 1.5 eV and the Sn6Se6 nanowire presents a semi-metallic character. Raman spectra of composite SnSe@SWCNT samples show that the radial breathing mode of the nanotubes is strongly suppressed indicating interaction between SWCNT and the encapsulated SnSe nanowire while the Fano asymmetry parameter of the _G_ band is increased.
 

Paper 11: [Quantitative monitoring of the removal of non-encapsulated material external to filled carbon nanotube samples](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2015/cp/c5cp04664e) (2015, 14 cites)
 Abstract: The endohedral functionalization of carbon nanotubes with both organic and inorganic materials allows the development of tailored functional hybrids whose properties benefit from the synergistic effects of the constituent compounds. Bulk filling of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) results in samples that contain a large amount of non-encapsulated material external to the CNTs. The presence of the external material is detrimental to the processing and application of the resulting hybrids. Here we introduce the use of UV-Vis spectroscopy to monitor the cleaning process, i.e. the elimination of non-encapsulated compounds. Chrome azurol S has been employed to assess the bulk removal of external samarium(III) chloride from filled single-walled carbon nanotubes. Chrome azurol S is of interest since it can be used to quantify a large variety of materials in a fast, accurate and reliable manner. The parameters that control the cleaning process have been optimized, including the time, temperature, volume and sonication, to achieve a fast and complete removal of the external material.
 

Paper 12: [Encapsulation of cadmium telluride nanocrystals within single walled carbon nanotubes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020169318317626) (2019, 10 cites)
 Abstract: The encapsulation of crystal structures of cadmium telluride within small diameter single walled nanotubes (SWNTs) are studied using density functional theory with a dispersion correction (DFT + D). Four different suitable pseudo one-dimensional (1-d) CdTe crystals were considered and their energies were compared. The isolated **4:2** crystal (derived from the hexagonal CdTe bulk) was calculated to be the most thermodynamically stable of the four structures. Calculations were performed on the **4:2** crystal inserted into three different SWNTs, (8, 8), (9, 9), and (10, 10), in order to investigate energy of formation of the CdTe@SWNT composites. The calculated encapsulation energies show that the interaction between nanotubes and the CdTe crystals is noncovalent. Since the energy difference of the “free” **4:2** and **3:3** structures is small (0.07 eV/CdTe), we carried out calculations on **3:3** CdTe structure encapsulated in two different SWNTs, (9, 9) and (10, 10). The calculated binding energies are exoergic suggesting that this polymorph may also be found experimentally. The other two structures are also encapsulated and their results are discussed though they can be found within SWNTs at high temperatures. The present study proposes that both **4:2** and **3:3** CdTe structures can be observed in the microscopic experiments and further experimental verification is required.
 

Paper 13: [The impact of dimensionality and stoichiometry of CuBr on its coupling to sp2-carbon](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000862231530511X) (2016, 10 cites)
 Abstract: A possible coupling of one-dimensional crystal to their template material plays crucial role when its electronic structure is evaluated. Here a comparative study of the interaction between CuBr and _sp_ _2_ -carbon in 1D and 2D structures as probed by X-ray absorption, photoemission and DFT calculations is reported. The 1D system, i.e. a non-stoichiometric CuBr crystal embedded into a single-walled carbon nanotube (CuBr@SWNT) revealed notable hybridization in contrast to a CuBr film deposited on graphene or graphite. CuBr is coupled to the nanotube due to its low dimensionality and strong coordination deficiency of atoms thus forming one-dimensional nanocrystal, which is non-free-standing.
 

Paper 14: [Selective imaging of discrete polyoxometalate ions on graphene oxide under variable voltage conditions](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsnano.5b05898) (2016, 9 cites)
 Abstract: Monosubstituted lacunary Keggin [CoSiW11O39]6– ions on graphene oxide (GO) were used in a comparative imaging study using aberration corrected transmission electron microscopy at two different acceleration voltages, 80 and 200 kV. By performing a set of static and dynamical studies, together with image simulations, we show how the use of lower voltages results in better stability and resolution of the underlying GO support while the use of higher voltages permits better resolution of the individual tungsten atoms and leads to less kinetic motion of the cluster, thus leading to a more accurate identification of cluster orientation and better stability under dynamical imaging conditions. Applying different voltages also influences the visibility of both GO and the lighter Co at lower or higher voltages, respectively.
 

Paper 15: [CoO-SnSe monolayer: A high potential candidate for SF6 characteristic decomposition gas adsorption and detection](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927775724005326) (2024, 7 cites)
 Abstract: Insulation performance testing of gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) and treatment of SF6 decomposition products under partial discharge are two crucial studies. In this paper, the adsorption behavior and sensor properties of five characteristic decomposition gases of SF6 (HF, H2S, SO2, SOF2, SO2F2) on intrinsic and CoO-doped SnSe monolayers are investigated in detail based on density-functional theory. The results showed that the adsorption behaviors of HF, H2S, SOF2, and SO2F2 on SnSe monolayers were all physisorption among which the best adsorption was SO2 with an adsorption energy of −0.618 eV, which is a weak chemisorption. After doping with CoO, the adsorption capacity of SnSe monolayer for five gases was significantly enhanced, in which the adsorption energies for SO2 and SOF2 reached −1.356 eV and −1.175 eV, respectively. In addition, the conductivity of the system is greatly improved, with the bandgap changing from 1.129 eV to 0 eV. The microscopic mechanism of the interaction of gas molecules with CoO-SnSe monolayers has been revealed by energy band structure (Eg), density of states (DOS), Milligan charge analysis (∆ Q) and electrostatic potential. Finally, the sensitivity (S) and desorption time (τ) of the five adsorption systems were calculated to illustrate the macroscopic gas-sensitive properties of the system. This work will help to explore the application of CoO-SnSe monolayers in SF6 decomposition gas sensing detection and adsorption treatment.
 

Paper 16: [Self-limiting stoichiometry in SnSe thin films](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2023/nr/d3nr00645j) (2023, 6 cites)
 Abstract: Unique functionalities can arise when 2D materials are scaled down near the monolayer limit. However, in 2D materials with strong van der Waals bonds between layers, such as SnSe, maintaining stoichiometry while limiting vertical growth is difficult. Here, we describe how self-limiting stoichiometry can promote the growth of SnSe thin films deposited by molecular beam epitaxy. The Pnma phase of SnSe was stabilized over a broad range of Sn:Se flux ratios from 1:1 to 1:5. Changing the flux ratio does not affect the film stoichiometry but influences the predominant crystallographic orientation. ReaxFF molecular dynamics (MD) simulation demonstrates that, while a mixture of Sn/Se stoichiometries forms initially, SnSe stabilizes as the cluster size evolves. The MD results further show that the excess selenium coalesces into Se clusters that weakly interact with the surface of the SnSe particles, leading to the limited stoichiometric change. Raman spectroscopy corroborates this model showing the initial formation of SnSe2 transitioning into SnSe as experimental film growth progresses. Transmission electron microscopy measurements taken on films deposited with growth rates above 0.25 Å s−1 show a thin layer of SnSe2 that disrupts the crystallographic orientation of the SnSe films. Therefore, using the conditions for self-limiting SnSe growth while avoiding the formation of SnSe2 was found to increase the lateral scale of the SnSe layers. Overall, self-limiting stoichiometry provides a promising avenue for maintaining growth of large lateral-scale SnSe for device fabrication.

 Abstract: Industrialization of green hydrogen production through electrolyzers is hindered by cost-effective electrocatalysts and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, a facile one-step hydrothermal technique for the in situ growth of non-noble tin chalcogenides and their heterostructures on nickel foam (NF) as trifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), OER, and methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) is detailed. Among them, the heterostructured SnSe/SnTe/NF outperforms all others and recently reported catalysts, boasting an impressively low potential of −0.077, 1.51, and 1.33 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode to achieve 10 mA cm−2 for HER, OER, and MOR. Owing to the rod-like morphology with hetero-phases for enhancing the performance. Furthermore, a hybrid MOR-mediated water electrolyzer requiring only 1.49 V to achieve 10 mA cm−2 with value-added formate is introduced and traditional water electrolyzer is outperformed. Additionally, a zero-gap commercial anion-exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) with bifunctional SnSe/SnTe/NF electrodes is tested, successfully achieving an industrially required 1 A cm−2 at a low potential of 1.93 V at 70 °C. Moreover, AEMWE using a windmill is powered and H2 and O2 production with wind speed is measured. Overall, this work paves the development of unexplored tin chalcogenide heterostructure as a potent candidate for cost-effective, energy-efficient, and carbon-neutral hydrogen production.
 

Paper 19: [Single-walled carbon nanotubes: synthesis and modification of the electronic structure](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789814678919_0005) (2016, 4 cites)
 Abstract: **Abstract:** Despite the fact that methods of the synthesis of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are well-established, they allow obtaining only mixtures of SWCNTs with different electronic properties. The development of approaches of controlling the electronic structure of SWCNTs opens a way to prepare nanotube samples with uniform properties that are required for applications. This chapter reviews the methods of the synthesis of SWCNTs and the modification of their electronic structure. The arc-discharge, laser ablation and chemical vapor deposition methods for the synthesis of nanotubes are presented. The modification of the electronic properties of SWCNTs as a result of the intercalation of the bundles, the chemical modification of the outer surface, the substitution of carbon atoms of walls and the filling of internal channels are discussed. The advantages of the filling of SWCNTs for tailoring their electronic properties are highlighted. The reported results on the investigation of the electronic properties of filled SWCNTs by spectroscopic techniques are summarized.

 Abstract: The single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are known for their exceptional physical, chemical, mechanical, and structural properties. This makes them prospective components of nanoscale and molecular electronic devices. For instance, applications of SWCNTs in the fields of nanoelectronics, bioelectronics, and thin-film flexible electronics have been already realized. Although sufficient progress has been made in constructing nanotube-based elements of nanoelectronics, full potential of SWCNTs is still not implemented in practical applications. The limiting factor is the presence of nanotubes of both conductivity types (metallic and semiconducting) in the typical synthesized samples, which causes inhomogeneity of their electronic properties.
 

Paper 22: [Facile Phase-Selectable Chemical Synthesis of Tin Selenide Nanosheets toward Nanostructured Materials for Energy-Related Applications](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c03026) (2023, 2 cites)
 Abstract: Here, we present a facile, phase-selectable, size-controllable chemical method for the synthesis of Sn-Se nanosheets (NSs). The resultant NSs were characterized using XRD, SEM, TEM, STEM, and EDS. Phase control was achieved by changing the input molar ratio of Sn:Se. At ratios of 1:1 and 1:2, pure-phase, rectangular SnSe NSs; at ratios of 1:6 and 1:10, pure-phase, hexagonal SnSe2 NSs; and at a ratio of 1:4, a mix of the two NSs were produced. The produced NSs were large (a few hundred nm in diameter) and thin (10–20 nm), although there was no significant increase in the optical band gap calculated from UV–vis–NIR spectroscopy, indicating an absence of quantum confinement effects. Size control of both phases was achieved by changing the amount of the ligand, trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO). Increasing the amount of TOPO decreased the size of the SnSe NSs and increased the size of the SnSe2 NSs. Finally, the formation mechanism was investigated and it was found that the formation of metal-ion complexes, namely, Sn-TOPO and Se-oleylamine, played an important role in the phase selectivity and size distribution of the NSs by changing the effective ratio of Sn:Se and slowing the nucleation of the NSs.
 

Paper 23: [One-dimensional polyhedral chain of ThCl6 encapsulated within single-walled carbon nanotubes](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article/11/6/065117/991623) (2021, 1 cites)
 Abstract: Using density functional theory together with dispersion correction, we optimize geometries and calculate encapsulation energies, charge transfer, and electronic structures of a one-dimensional ThCl6 chain encapsulated within single-walled carbon nanotubes. The optimized structures are in agreement with the experimentally observed single chain of ThCl6 confined within nanotubes. Exoergic encapsulation energies indicate that the chain is thermodynamically stable inside the nanotubes. The inclusion of dispersion correction enhanced the encapsulation. The strong nature of encapsulation is further confirmed by the charge transfer between the nanotubes and the chain. The one-dimensional chain structure exhibits a small increase (0.20 eV) in the bandgap compared to that of bulk ThCl4. The metallic (15,0) tube becomes a narrow gap semiconductor upon encapsulation, while the semiconducting nature of the (17,0) tube is still kept despite the reduction in the bandgap.

 Abstract: Rapid saturation of electronic current in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) under bias voltage has been observed in several recent experimental and theoretical studies. This effect, caused by scattering with lattice vibrations, limits otherwise promising applications of CNTs in nanoelectronics. Here we propose a mechanism to enhance the electrical performance of metallic CNTs by encapsulation of one-dimensional nanowires. Although experimental studies of such structures are increasingly common, our first-principles study combined with the coupled electron-phonon dynamics is the first to explicitly demonstrate their enhanced functional performance relative to an empty metallic CNT.

Paper 31: [Modelling nanowires: crystals encapsulated in carbon nanotubes.](https://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/90152/) (2016, 0 cites)
 Abstract: Nanotube-encapsulated ionic materials can be usefully modelled using ab initio methods to inform and validate experiment. This thesis models these materials using density functional theory, explores the specific challenges these materials pose, and presents results only visible once these challenges are addressed.

Chemical potentials and ab initio calculations are used to predict tube radii at which filling occurs for a range of filling conditions, which informs our choice of tube.

The practice of fitting both ionic core and encapsulating tube into the same unit cell causes artificial strain. A method of quantifying this mismatch is developed and the associated strain energy and distortions predicted.

Current methods of approximating the nanotube treat it as a smooth cylinder. We find significant texture which can resist core movement, allow metastable twisted states, and be used to determine which supercells have physically realistic mismatch strain.

Cores have previously been relaxed in vacuo with limited justification. We find that, in general, cores are not stable without constraints. We guide three bare silver iodide ansatze to metastable saddle-points by applying artificial symmetry constraints during in vacuo relaxation. An investigation into their unconstrained unstable phonon modes reveals them to be stabilised by an encapsulating tube. Two classes of stabilisation are identified, one due to radial encapsulation and a second due to mismatch-like effects.

Charge of a few tenths of e per core ion is seen to transfer from core to tube, with magnitude depending on tube radius. In order to approximate the charge field by atomic charges, four population analysis schemes are investigated. The Bader and Density Derived Electrostatic and Chemical (DDEC) population analyses agree to physically sensible values while using different approaches. A machine-learned model is trained using local chemical-environment descriptors to transferrably predict atomic charges to within 0.004 e of DDEC values with an orders-of-magnitude speedup.

Paper 32: [High Performance Thermoelectric Monocrystalline Tin Selenide Growth using Vertical Bridgman Technique](https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:3e67d36) (2018, 0 cites)
 Abstract: Thermoelectricity is gaining increasing popularity in recent years due to the need of higher
energy efficiency and greener energy production. Among many thermoelectric materials, single
crystal SnSe, which was reported to have a remarkable ZT=2.6 at 923K, has large potential in
making advanced thermoelectric devices in the future (e.g. power generators and refrigerators).
In this review paper, the important background of thermoelectricity will be introduced including
the history of development, the most commonly used measuring standards of TE performance:
‘figure of merit’ as well as its important parameters including Seebeck coefficient,
thermal/electrical conductivity etc. as well as the TE devices efficiency. It will focus on
monocrystalline SnSe, a high performance p-type semiconductor, in terms of its crystal
structure, bandgap and α-β phase conversion etc. Then the sources of the remarkable TE
performance will be analyzed. Finally, the famous single crystal growth method: Vertical
Bridgman technique is going to be shown as well. The content will include the initial Bridgman
method, later modification as well as the apparatus usage for making single crystal SnSe. The
experimental equipment will also be referred in the last section.
