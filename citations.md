Paper 1: [The problem with determining atomic structure at the nanoscale](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1135080) (2007, 831 cites)
 Abstract: Emerging complex functional materials often have atomic order limited to the nanoscale. Examples include nanoparticles, species encapsulated in mesoporous hosts, and bulk crystals with intrinsic nanoscale order. The powerful methods that we have for solving the atomic structure of bulk crystals fail for such materials. Currently, no broadly applicable, quantitative, and robust methods exist to replace crystallography at the nanoscale. We provide an overview of various classes of nanostructured materials and review the methods that are currently used to study their structure. We suggest that successful solutions to these nanostructure problems will involve interactions among researchers from materials science, physics, chemistry, computer science, and applied mathematics, working within a “complex modeling” paradigm that combines theory and experiment in a self-consistent computational framework.
 

Paper 2: [Crystallization in confinement](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adma.202001068) (2020, 218 cites)
 Abstract: Many crystallization processes of great importance, including frost heave, biomineralization, the synthesis of nanomaterials, and scale formation, occur in small volumes rather than bulk solution. Here, the influence of confinement on crystallization processes is described, drawing together information from fields as diverse as bioinspired mineralization, templating, pharmaceuticals, colloidal crystallization, and geochemistry. Experiments are principally conducted within confining systems that offer well-defined environments, varying from droplets in microfluidic devices, to cylindrical pores in filtration membranes, to nanoporous glasses and carbon nanotubes. Dramatic effects are observed, including a stabilization of metastable polymorphs, a depression of freezing points, and the formation of crystals with preferred orientations, modified morphologies, and even structures not seen in bulk. Confinement is also shown to influence crystallization processes over length scales ranging from the atomic to hundreds of micrometers, and to originate from a wide range of mechanisms. The development of an enhanced understanding of the influence of confinement on crystal nucleation and growth will not only provide superior insight into crystallization processes in many real-world environments, but will also enable this phenomenon to be used to control crystallization in applications including nanomaterial synthesis, heavy metal remediation, and the prevention of weathering.
 

Paper 3: [Nanocarbon composites and hybrids in sustainability: a review](https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cssc.201100536) (2012, 210 cites)
 Abstract: There is an ever-growing need to protect our environment by increasing energy efficiency and developing “clean” energy sources. These are global challenges, and their resolution is vital to our energy security. Although many conventional materials, such as metals, ceramics, and plastics, cannot fulfil all requirements for these new technologies, many material combinations can offer synergistic effects that create improved and even new properties. The implementation of nanocarbons, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes, into nanocomposites and, more recently, into the new class of hybrids, are very promising examples. In contrast to classical nanocomposites, where a low volume fraction of the carbon component is mixed into a polymer or ceramic matrix, hybrids are materials in which nanocarbon is coated with a thin layer of the functional compound, which introduces the interface as a powerful new parameter. Based on interfacial charge and energy transfer processes, nanocarbon hybrids have shown increased sensitivities in gas sensors, improved efficiencies in photovoltaics, superior activities in photocatalysts, and enhanced capacities in supercapacitors. This review compares the characteristics and potentials of both nanocarbon composites and hybrids, highlights recent developments in their synthesis and discusses key challenges for their use in various energy applications.
 

Paper 4: [Hybrid carbon nanotubes: Strategy, progress, and perspectives](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-materials-research/article/hybrid-carbon-nanotubes-strategy-progress-and-perspectives/A73017400FB16CB601031A4156AEFE48) (2006, 177 cites)
 Abstract: We introduce the concept of meta-nanotubes, among which are hybrid carbon nanotubes (X@CNTs), which are CNTs whose hollow core is filled—fully or partially—with foreign atoms, molecules, or compounds. The article focuses on the latter, describing their potential interest and the various ways currently available to synthesize them, while providing examples of the resulting materials mainly taken from the author’s works but also from literature, as characterized by means of high-resolution microscopy and related techniques. We discuss advantages and drawbacks of the various synthesis routes to help willing scientists and engineers to define a strategy for X@CNT synthesis with respect to their specific goals and expectations. Some examples of peculiar properties and behaviors of X@CNTs will be provided as well, although such related investigations are still scarcely reported because we are dealing with quite new nanomaterials.
 

Paper 5: [Proton core heating and beam formation via parametrically unstable Alfvén-cyclotron waves](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.125003) (2008, 134 cites)
 Abstract: Vlasov theory and one-dimensional hybrid simulations are used to study the effects that compressible fluctuations driven by parametric instabilities Alfvén-cyclotron waves have on proton velocity distributions. Field-aligned proton beams are generated during the saturation phase of the wave-particle interaction, with a drift speed which is slightly greater than the Alfvén speed and is maintained until the end of the simulation. The main part of the distribution becomes anisotropic due to phase mixing as is typically observed in the velocity distributions measured in the fast solar wind. We identify the key instabilities and also find that, even in the parameter regime where fluid theory appears to be appropriate, strong kinetic effects still prevail.
 

Paper 6: [Advances in tailoring the electronic properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079642515000912) (2016, 120 cites)
 Abstract: Considerable progress has been made in the last several years in the fields of investigation and understanding of the influence of encapsulated substances on the electronic properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Relevant data on the modified electronic properties of filled SWCNTs were obtained. The possibility of achieving both acceptor and donor doping and precise changes of the SWCNT doping level by the filling of channels and transformation of incorporated substances was demonstrated. This article presents a comprehensive review of the current status of the research on the electronic properties of filled SWCNTs. The review begins with a brief description of basic aspects of the band theory of solids and peculiarities of the band structure and electronic properties of SWCNTs. The next part of the review is dedicated to a systematization and description of different methods for modification of the SWCNT electronic properties. Then, the review introduces filling methods of SWCNT inner channels. The main part of the review is dedicated to an analysis, systematization and generalization of the up-to-date reported results on experimental and theoretical investigations of the electronic properties of filled SWCNTs and nanostructures obtained as result of chemical reactions inside the SWCNT channels. Finally, the possible applications of filled nanotubes are highlighted.

 Abstract: Turbulent spectral cascades are investigated by means of fully three-dimensional (3D) simulations of a compressible Hall-magnetohydrodynamic (H-MHD) plasma in order to understand the observed spectral break in the solar wind turbulence spectra in the regime where the characteristic length scales associated with electromagnetic fluctuations are smaller than the ion gyroradius. In this regime, the results of our 3D simulations exhibit that turbulent spectral cascades in the presence of a mean magnetic field follow an omnidirectional anisotropic inertial-range spectrum close to k−7/3. The latter is associated with the Hall current arising from nonequal electron and ion fluid velocities in our 3D H-MHD plasma model.
 

Paper 9: [Single-atom scale structural selectivity in Te nanowires encapsulated inside ultranarrow, single-walled carbon nanotubes](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsnano.7b02225) (2017, 80 cites)
 Abstract: Extreme nanowires (ENs) represent the ultimate class of crystals: They are the smallest possible periodic materials. With atom-wide motifs repeated in one dimension (1D), they offer a privileged perspective into the physics and chemistry of low-dimensional systems. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) provide ideal environments for the creation of such materials. Here we present a comprehensive study of Te ENs encapsulated inside ultranarrow SWCNTs with diameters between 0.7 nm and 1.1 nm. We combine state-of-the-art imaging techniques and 1D-adapted ab initio structure prediction to treat both confinement and periodicity effects. The studied Te ENs adopt a variety of structures, exhibiting a true 1D realization of a Peierls structural distortion and transition from metallic to insulating behavior as a function of encapsulating diameter. We analyze the mechanical stability of the encapsulated ENs and show that nanoconfinement is not only a useful means to produce ENs but also may actually be necessary, in some cases, to prevent them from disintegrating. The ability to control functional properties of these ENs with confinement has numerous applications in future device technologies, and we anticipate that our study will set the basic paradigm to be adopted in the characterization and understanding of such systems.
 

Paper 10: [Confined crystals of the smallest phase-change material](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl4010354) (2013, 77 cites)
 Abstract: The demand for high-density memory in tandem with limitations imposed by the minimum feature size of current storage devices has created a need for new materials that can store information in smaller volumes than currently possible. Successfully employed in commercial optical data storage products, phase-change materials, that can reversibly and rapidly change from an amorphous phase to a crystalline phase when subject to heating or cooling have been identified for the development of the next generation electronic memories. There are limitations to the miniaturization of these devices due to current synthesis and theoretical considerations that place a lower limit of 2 nm on the minimum bit size, below which the material does not transform in the structural phase. We show here that by using carbon nanotubes of less than 2 nm diameter as templates phase-change nanowires confined to their smallest conceivable scale are obtained. Contrary to previous experimental evidence and theoretical expectations, the nanowires are found to crystallize at this scale and display amorphous-to-crystalline phase changes, fulfilling an important prerequisite of a memory element. We show evidence for the smallest phase-change material, extending thus the size limit to explore phase-change memory devices at extreme scales.

 Abstract: The state-of-the-art methods for filling single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are analyzed systematically. In situ and ex situ approaches for filling SWNTs are addressed. They are based on both intercalation of inorganic substances from the gas phase, solution or melts inside SWNTs and the formation of nanocrystals inside the channels as a result of chemical reactions. A comparative evaluation of these methods is performed, and major requirements for successful formation of '1D-crystal@SWNT' nanocomposites are formulated. The functional properties of the intercalated single-walled nanotubes and their possible applications in modern nanotechnologies are discussed.
 

Paper 12: [Growth and characterization of one-dimensional SnTe crystals within the single-walled carbon nanotube channels](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp1107087) (2011, 63 cites)
 Abstract: Quasi-free-standing one-dimensional (1D) SnTe crystals were grown within the channels of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) from the melt using the capillary technique. The crystal structure of the 1D SnTe crystal was determined from transmission electron microscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations. The obtained structure for the 1D crystal—(SnTe)5 _n_ —shows in comparison to the bulk structure a significant bond length relaxation (contraction) along the SWCNT axis, which is accompanied by a decrease of the Sn and Te effective charges. In contrast to bulk rocksalt SnTe and 1D (SnTe)4 _n_ crystal as well, the (SnTe)5 _n_ crystal shows the gapless band structure due to the contribution of orbitals mostly composed by three-coordinated atoms. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy data indicate that there are no noticeable interactions between the 1D SnTe crystal and the SWCNTs other than a minor donor influence on the electron structure of metallic SWCNTs; this influence is in line with gapless state of (SnTe)5 _n_.
 

Paper 13: [Electrochemical opening of single-walled carbon nanotubes filled with metal halides and with closed ends](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp802127p) (2008, 57 cites)
 Abstract: The electrochemical opening of closed-ended, pristine single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) upon the application of either a sufficiently oxidizing or reducing electrode potential is reported. Hitherto, it has been unclear whether the side walls of SWCNTs are electrochemically active, or whether, like their multiwalled counterparts (MWCNTs), the electroactive sites on SWCNTs also reside at the edge-plane-like defects at the open ends of the tubes. Evidence is presented herein that suggests the latter case is true, i.e., that SWCNTs require edge-plane sites to be electroactive. Comparisons of the voltammetric response of end-closed SWCNTs (EC-SWCNTs), end-open (EO-SWCNTs), and SWCNTs encapsulating a metal halide filling (MX@SWCNTs, where MX represents either NaI or CuI) in aqueous electrolytes indicate that SWCNTs undergo electrochemical opening if the applied electrode potential is greater than +1.2 V vs SCE or less than −1.5 V vs SCE. This was further confirmed using ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The nonaqueous voltammetry of NaCl@SWCNTs, NaI@SWCNTs, CuI@SWCNTs, and ZnCl2@SWCNTs in dimethyl formamide (DMF) containing 0.1 M tetrabutyl ammonium perchlorate (TBAP) all exhibited voltammetric responses identical to that of EC-SWCNTs unless the potential was cycled beyond ca. +1.6 V vs Ag (+2.129 V vs the cobaltocene/cobaltocenium redox couple) whereupon voltammetry corresponding to the filling material was observed, again indicating that the SWCNTs had become open-ended. Evidence for quantized charging of the EC-SWCNTs is presented in terms of the unusual “bow-tie” shape of the background charging current in DMF is also presented.
 

Paper 14: [High yield synthesis and characterization of the structural and magnetic properties of crystalline ErCl3 nanowires in single-walled carbon nanotube templates](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12274-008-8013-8) (2008, 57 cites)
 Abstract: Crystalline ErCl3 nanowires have been fabricated in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with high yield (∼90%), and the structural and magnetic properties of the resulting ErCl3 nanowires encapsulated in SWCNTs (ErCl3@SWCNTs) characterized. Encapsulation under high temperature and vacuum using high quality SWCNTs results in a high filling-ratio of ErCl3 nanowires in the SWCNTs. The high filling-ratio of ErCl3 nanowires and the use of highly pure SWCNTs with only a small amount of residual Fe catalyst nanoparticles enabled us to observe the magnetic properties of ErCl3@SWCNTs. Structure determination based on simulated annealing calculations and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image simulations revealed that the structure of the ErCl3 nanowires is unusual with respect to the coordination environment of the Eu3+ ions. This work opens up new possibilities to fabricate various metal complex nanowires with high yield and may also be of more general importance in understanding and exploring magnetic properties in low-dimensional magnetic systems.

 Abstract: The current status of research on the electronic properties of filled single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is reviewed. SWCNT atomic structure and electronic properties are described, and their correlation is discussed. Methods for modifying the electronic properties of SWCNTs are considered. SWCNT filling materials are systematized. Experimental and theoretical data on the electronic properties of filled SWCNTs are analyzed. Possible application areas for filled SWCNTs are explored.
 

Paper 16: [Direct imaging of the structure, relaxation, and sterically constrained motion of encapsulated tungsten polyoxometalate Lindqvist ions within carbon nanotubes](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn7002508) (2008, 52 cites)
 Abstract: The imaging properties and observation of the sterically regulated translational motion of discrete tungsten polyoxometalate Lindqvist ions (i.e., [W6O19]2−) within carbon nanotubes of specific internal diameter are reported. The translational motion of the nonspheroidal anion within the nanotube capillary is found to be impeded by its near-perfect accommodation to the internal van der Waals surface of the nanotube wall. Rotational motion of the anion about one remaining degree of freedom permits translational motion of the anion along the nanotube followed by locking in at sterically favorable positions in a mechanism similar to a molecular ratchet. This steric locking permits the successful direct imaging of the constituent octahedral cation template of individual [W6O19]2− anions by high resolution transmission electron microscopy thereby permitting metrological measurements to be performed directly on the anion. Direct imaging of pairs of equatorial W2 atoms within the anion reveal steric relaxation of the anion contained within the nanotube capillary relative to the bulk anion structure.

Paper 18: [The non-covalent functionalisation of carbon nanotubes studied by density functional and semi-empirical molecular orbital methods including dispersion corrections](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2008/cp/b711498b) (2008, 46 cites)
 Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT-D) and semi-empirical (PM3-D) methods having an added empirical dispersion correction have been used to study the binding of a series of small molecules and planar aromatic molecules to single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs). For the small molecule set, the PM3-D method gives a mean unsigned error (MUE) in the binding energies of 1.2 kcal mol−1 when judged against experimental reference data for graphitic carbon. This value is close to the MUE for this method compared to high-level ab initio data for biological complexes. The PM3-D and DFT-D calculations describing the adsorption of the planar organic molecules (benzene, bibenzene, naphthalene, anthracene, TCNQ and DDQ) on the outer-walls of both semi-conducting and metallic CNTs give similar binding energies for benzene and DDQ, but do not display a stronger adsorption on [6,6] compared to [10,0] structures shown by another DFT study.
 

Paper 19: [Comparison of modification of electronic properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes filled with metal halogenide, chalcogenide, and pure metal](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00339-013-7808-y) (2013, 44 cites)
 Abstract: In present work, thulium chloride, gallium selenide, bismuth telluride, and silver were encapsulated into the channels of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). The structural properties of obtained nanostructures were studied by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and the modification of electronic properties of nanotubes as result of filling their channels with chosen substances was investigated by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was shown that the electronic properties of filled SWCNTs depend on the chemical nature of incorporated materials. The encapsulation of TmCl3 and GaSe into the carbon nanotube channels leads to acceptor doping of the SWCNTs, and this effect is more prominent for thulium chloride. The incorporation of bismuth telluride into the nanotube cavities does not result in any modification of their electronic properties. The filling of the nanotube channels with silver leads to donor doping of the single-walled carbon nanotubes.
 

Paper 20: [Raman spectroscopy of optical transitions and vibrational energies of∼ 1 nm HgTe extreme nanowires within single walled carbon nanotubes](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn5023632) (2014, 42 cites)
 Abstract: This paper presents a resonance Raman spectroscopy study of ∼1 nm diameter HgTe nanowires formed inside single walled carbon nanotubes by melt infiltration. Raman spectra have been measured for ensembles of bundled filled tubes, produced using tubes from two separate sources, for excitation photon energies in the ranges 3.39–2.61 and 1.82–1.26 eV for Raman shifts down to ∼25 cm–1. We also present HRTEM characterization of the tubes and the results of DFT calculations of the phonon and electronic dispersion relations, and the optical absorption spectrum based upon the observed structure of the HgTe nanowires. All of the evidence supports the hypothesis that the observed Raman features are not attributable to single walled carbon nanotubes, _i.e._ , peaks due to radial breathing mode phonons, but are due to the HgTe nanowires. The observed additional features are due to four distinct phonons, with energies 47, 51, 94, and 115 cm–1, respectively, plus their overtones and combinations. All of these modes have strong photon energy resonances that maximize at around 1.76 eV energy with respect to incident laser.
 

Paper 21: [Unprecedented new crystalline forms of SnSe in narrow to medium diameter carbon nanotubes](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b00133) (2019, 41 cites)
 Abstract: We report the observation of four unprecedented new crystalline forms of SnSe, obtained as a result of encapsulation in narrow to medium diameter single-walled carbon nanotubes. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy at 80 kV revealed linear, zigzag, helical (i.e., 2 × 1) atomic chains and a new form of encapsulated SnSe. This new form is apparently isostructural to free-standing MoS, MoSe, and WSe extreme nanowires etched from the corresponding monolayer dichalcogenides and also recently observed encapsulated MoTe. A structural model has been attained from annular dark-field (ADF) images. The experimental imaging agrees well with image simulations produced from models anticipated for the new structural forms.
 

Paper 22: [Charge transfer in single-walled carbon nanotubes filled with cadmium halogenides](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10853-013-7653-6) (2013, 41 cites)
 Abstract: In this work the internal channels of the single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were filled with cadmium chloride, cadmium bromide, and cadmium iodide by a capillary method using melts of these salts. The influence of incorporated chemical compounds on the electronic properties of the carbon nanotubes was investigated by optical absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was found that there is the chemical bonding between carbon atoms of nanotube walls and metal atoms of encapsulated CdX2 nanocrystals. The obtained data testify acceptor doping effect of cadmium halogenides incorporated into the SWCNT channels, which is accompanied by the charge transfer from nanotube walls to introduced substances.
 

Paper 23: [Van der Waals heterostructures with one-dimensional atomic crystals](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079642521000803) (2021, 37 cites)
 Abstract: As one of the well-defined classes of low-dimensional materials, one-dimensional (1D) materials and related heterostructures have aroused broad interest due to their unique physical properties and widespread applications over the past decades. The concept of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure, which has gained great success in superlattice of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, can be also extended to heterostructures with 1D atomic crystals. Due to the less rigid requirement on lattice matching, versatility of foreign materials with different dimensionalities can be integrated with the 1D templates via non-covalent bonding. Such 1D vdW heterostructures are expected to exhibit intriguing physical properties and functionalities that cannot be realized in single-component 1D material. This review article aims to provide a succinct and critical survey of the emerging 1D vdW heterostructures. We start with an overview of the configuration and summarize the synthetic strategies of 1D vdW heterostructures. Next, we discuss their physical properties with emphasis on those originated from the unique structure–property relationship, including spatial confinement effect and phase transition, band structure and electrical properties, optical properties, thermal properties and environmental stability, and directional mass transport. The emerging applications of 1D vdW heterostructures in electronic, photonic, optoelectronic and energy storage fields are comprehensively overviewed. Last, we conclude with a brief perspective on the opportunities as well as challenges of vdW heterostructures with 1D atomic crystals.
 

Paper 24: [Band gap expansion, shear inversion phase change behaviour and low-voltage induced crystal oscillation in low-dimensional tin selenide crystals](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2014/dt/c4dt00185k) (2014, 36 cites)
 Abstract: In common with rocksalt-type alkali halide phases and also semiconductors such as GeTe and SnTe, SnSe forms all-surface two atom-thick low dimensional crystals when encapsulated within single walled nanotubes (SWNTs) with diameters below ∼1.4 nm. Whereas previous density functional theory (DFT) studies indicate that optimised low-dimensional trigonal HgTe changes from a semi-metal to a semi-conductor, low-dimensional SnSe crystals typically undergo band-gap expansion. In slightly wider diameter SWNTs (∼1.4–1.6 nm), we observe that three atom thick low dimensional SnSe crystals undergo a previously unobserved form of a shear inversion phase change resulting in two discrete strain states in a section of curved nanotube. Under low-voltage (i.e. 80–100 kV) imaging conditions in a transmission electron microscope, encapsulated SnSe crystals undergo longitudinal and rotational oscillations, possibly as a result of the increase in the inelastic scattering cross-section of the sample at those voltages.

Paper 26: [Meta-and hybrid-CNTs: A clue for the future development of carbon nanotubes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928493106002712) (2007, 34 cites)
 Abstract: A new generation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which may be named “meta-nanotubes”, is more and more the focus of the research worldwide. They result from the transformation of “regular” CNTs by various ways such as functionalisation, doping, substitution, etc. The new nanomaterials thereby created are likely to exhibit new behaviors, specifically regarding properties that pristine CNTs do not possess (reactivity, solubility, magnetism…). The paper includes the description of the various routes to synthesize hybrid CNTs and their related advantages and limitations, while providing examples of the resulting materials from both literature and author’s team work. Hybrid SWNTs (abbreviated as X@SWNTs) are one example of meta-nanotubes, and consist in SWNTs whose the hollow core is fully or partially filled with foreign atoms, molecules, or compounds. The inserted material may then exhibit a peculiar behavior with respect to the macroscopic state, for several non-exclusive reasons: 1D-dimension preventing electron scattering and enhancing the role of surface atoms, protection from surface adsorption of disturbing molecules by the carbon sheath, anisotropic lattice distortion or creation of new structures due to imposed dimensions, interactions/electron coupling with the surrounding carbon lattice. A wide field is thus open, possibly even wider than for pristine SWNTs.
 

Paper 27: [Stabilization of NbTe3, VTe3, and TiTe3 via Nanotube Encapsulation](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.0c10175) (2020, 34 cites)
 Abstract: The structure of MX3 transition metal trichalcogenides (TMTs, with M a transition metal and X a chalcogen) is typified by one-dimensional (1D) chains weakly bound together via van der Waals interactions. This structural motif is common across a range of M and X atoms (e.g., NbSe3, HfTe3, TaS3), but not all M and X combinations are stable. We report here that three new members of the MX3 family which are not stable in bulk, specifically NbTe3, VTe3, and TiTe3, can be synthesized in the few- (2–4) to single-chain limit via nanoconfined growth within the stabilizing cavity of multiwalled carbon nanotubes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) reveal the chain-like nature and the detailed atomic structure. The synthesized materials exhibit behavior unique to few-chain quasi-1D structures, such as few-chain spiraling and a trigonal antiprismatic rocking distortion in the single-chain limit. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insight into the crystal structure and stability of the materials, as well as their electronic structure.
 

Paper 28: [Self-Assembled Double Ladder Structure Formed Inside Carbon Nanotubes by Encapsulation of H8Si8O12](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn9002727) (2009, 33 cites)
 Abstract: Unique low-dimensional SiO2-based nanomaterials can be encapsulated and synthesized inside the nanometer-scale one-dimensional internal spaces of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). In this study, various single-walled CNTs (SWNTs) and double-walled CNTs (DWNTs) having different diameters are used as containers for cubic octameric H8Si8O12 molecules. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy observations revealed that, depending on the diameter of the CNTs, two types of structures are formed inside the SWNTs and DWNTs: In the case of those CNTs having inner diameters ranging from 1.2 to 1.4 nm, a new ordered self-assembled structure composed of H8Si4_n_ O8_n_ −4 molecules was formed through the transformation of H8Si8O12; however, in the case of CNTs having inner diameters larger than 1.7 nm, a disordered structure was formed. This behavior may indicate that strong interactions occur between the CNTs and the encapsulated H8Si4_n_ O8_n_ −4 molecules.
 

Paper 29: [Quantitative assessment of the amount of material encapsulated in filled carbon nanotubes](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp810717b) (2009, 33 cites)
 Abstract: In this paper, we present the first methodology for the quantitative assessment of the amount of material encapsulated in filled carbon nanotubes. Samples of single-walled carbon nanotubes have been filled by molten-phase capillary wetting with CuI, FeCl2, and CuBr. A suitable solvent has been used in each case to remove the large amount of external material present after the filling step. Thermogravimetric analyses in air have been performed to the empty and filled nanotubes, and the data have been used to obtain the filling yield for each sample. By using different starting nanotube samples, we stress the importance of the correct analysis of the data, which becomes more crucial for samples with larger quantities of metal catalyst impurities. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray electron dispersive spectroscopy experiments confirm the encapsulation of the desired compounds into the single-walled carbon nanotubes and the absence of external metal halides. The method proposed herein is accurate, simple, and can be easily implemented for a large variety of materials.
 

Paper 30: [Nanowires sheathed inside nanotubes: Manipulation, properties and applications](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079642514000887) (2015, 32 cites)
 Abstract: Since the discovery of metals encapsulated into multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), such sheathed structures attracted extensive interest with respect to the development of various synthetic strategies for producing the unique structure of nanowires sheathed inside nanotubes. The nanowire materials varied from metals to alloys, from semiconductors to insulators, and even metal–semiconductor heterojunctions were tried. In recent years, the studies on these nanostructures have been mainly focused on in-situ manipulation, property analysis and applications. Exploration of on-demand nano-engineering of the regarded structures toward practical device design and fabrication was mainly guided by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique combining new capabilities of implementation of atomic force (AFM) or scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) holders, and heating/cooling holders. Such novel in-situ TEM techniques have rapidly developed to a stage where they truly become a very powerful tool for the studies of core/shell nanowire heterostructures. In this review, we summarize the significant developments and achievements in regards of manipulation, property measurements and device applications of inorganic nanowires sheathed inside nanotubes according to different categories of the filling materials, i.e., metals, alloys, compounds and semiconductor–metal heterojunction nanowires. We also highlight the irreplaceable value of in-situ TEM technology in this field, compare different fillings for so-called nanothermometers, discuss mass transportation mechanism in nanotubes, and conclude with an outlook of future developments and challenging issues that are still in the premature stage.

 Abstract: FeCl2@OCHT, FeBr2@OCHT, and FeI2@OCHT nanocomposites were obtained by capillary filling of the channels of carbon single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) with melts of iron halogenides. The composites were studied by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), the capillary condensation of nitrogen at 77K, Raman spectroscopy, optical absorption spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and Moessbauer spectroscopy. Substantial distinctions in the combination scattering spectra of SWNTs and nanocomposites in the region of radial modes and in the region of longitudinal and tangential oscillations were revealed. The presence of electron transfer between the nanocrystal and the SWNT wall was established in the nanocomposites. For the FeCl2@OCHT nanocomposite, two states of Fe+2 were found: the first is characterized by electron transfer from the nanotube to the nanocrystal, which leads to the electron structure of the SWNT and FeCl2 changing; the second corresponds to the strained intercalated state resulting from the mechanical effect of the small SWNT diameter on the FeCl2 nanocrystal.
 

Paper 33: [A universal wet-chemistry route to metal filling of boron nitride nanotubes](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b03874) (2016, 29 cites)
 Abstract: We present a facile wet-chemistry method for efficient metal filling of the hollow inner cores of boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs). The fillers conform to the cross-section of the tube cavity and extend in length from a few nm to hundreds of nm. The methodology is robust and is demonstrated for noble metals (Au, Pt, Pd, and Ag), transition metals (Co), and post-transition elements (In). Transmission electron microscopy and related electron spectroscopy confirm the composition and morphology of the filler nanoparticles. Up to 60% of BNNTs of a given preparation batch have some degree of metal encapsulation, and individual tubes can have up to 10% of their core volume filled during initial loading. The growth, movement, and fusing of metal nanoparticles within the BNNTs are also examined.

 Abstract: The prospective of nitrogen doped graphene (NDG) as useful nonlinear optical (NLO) and charge transport materials is explored using first principles methods. A dual methodological strategy is adopted by performing molecular level and bulk level calculations through first principles methods. The calculated molecular geometry and absorption wavelengths are found to be in reasonable agreement with experimental results of parent NDG compound **1** (di-peri-(tert-butylbenzo)-di-peri-(tri-methoxybenzo)-di-peri-(pyrimidino)-coronene). Similarly, first principles calculations of the solid-state crystal structure show that NDG compound **1** retains a value of 1.585 eV as its direct band gap, which is potentially useful for a direct bad gap semiconductor for optical device applications. The calculation of second- (β) and third-order (γ) nonlinear optical properties indicates that compound **1** possesses reasonably large values of βtot (22.96 × 10−30 esu) and 〈γ〉 (238.53 × 10−36 esu) amplitudes, which may fall well within the figure of merit for second harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon absorption (TPA) applications, etc. TD-DFT calculations along with the plots of the frontier molecular orbitals show an intramolecular charge transfer from the rest of the graphene fragment to the pyridine moieties (N-doped sites) accompanied by significant oscillator strengths for involved transitions in the absorption spectra. Additionally, several key optical parameters (dielectric and conductivity functions, refractive index and extinction coefficients) are calculated to assess the overall optical efficiency of parent NDG compound **1**. The present investigation not only features the substantial potential of NDG compound **1** as an efficient optical material but also highlights the importance of the substitution of its terminal groups to enhance the first- and second hyperpolarizability amplitudes, as exemplified through the design of compound **3**.
 

Paper 35: [Synthesis of tellurium nanotubes via a green approach for detection and removal of mercury ions](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2021/xx/c3ra41824c) (2013, 28 cites)
 Abstract: In the present study, we develop a green approach for the preparation of tellurium nanotubes (Te NTs) by a simple fructose-mediated reduction of Te ions in an alkaline aqueous solution. The influence of reaction conditions, including the types of saccharides involved, reaction temperature, and fructose and NaOH concentrations on the size and morphology of Te nanostructures are investigated and the structural evolution with respect to different growth rates are illustrated. It is proposed that a low reduction reaction rate plays a significant role in the controlled growth mechanism of Te NTs. A simple gel-based membrane is also developed for the removal and sensing of mercury ions (Hg2+) in aqueous solutions. An agarose gel is used to trap as-prepared Te NTs, leading to the preparation of a nanocomposite film composed of Te NTs-modified agarose gel membrane (Te NTs–AGM) for removing Hg2+ in the solution via the strong hybridization and galvanic replacement reaction of Te–Hg. The Te NTs–AGM adsorbent allows effective removal of mercury species spiked in tap, stream, and sea waters with efficiencies greater than 97%. In addition, Te NTs allow for the rapid and simple detection of Hg2+ at concentrations as low as 10 nM. We validate the practicality of the use of Te NTs–AGM in this application through analyses of Hg2+ in tap water, stream water, and sea water samples. The low-cost, effective, and stable Te NTs–AGM nanocomposite shows great potential for detection and economical removal of Hg2+.
 

Paper 36: [Fermi level engineering of metallicity-sorted metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes by encapsulation of few-atom-thick crystals of silver chloride](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10853-018-2575-y) (2018, 28 cites)
 Abstract: In the present work, the channels of metallicity-sorted metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have been filled with silver chloride. The data of high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy proved the filling of the nanotube channels and formation of few-atom-thick crystals of silver chloride. The electronic properties of the filled SWCNTs were investigated by Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Our results indicate the _p_-doping of nanotubes by silver chloride accompanied by the charge transfer from the nanotubes to the encapsulated compound and the downshift of the Fermi level by 0.36 eV. The calculated number of transferred electrons per nanotube carbon atom and the charge transfer density per nanotube length amounted to 0.0024 e− per carbon and 0.0406 e−/Å, respectively. It was found that the band gap opens up in the band structure of the filled SWCNTs resulting in their transition from metallic into a semiconducting state. This work reveals a direct influence of the incorporated silver chloride on the electronic properties of metallicity-sorted metallic SWCNTs and demonstrates the potential of precise Fermi level engineering of SWCNTs by filling their channels and achieving high doping levels, thus providing a platform for designing next-generation nanoelectronic devices.

 Abstract: A single-step method of filling the channels of single-walled carbon nanotubes with the melt of refractory GaSe is proposed and successfully implemented. The filled nanotubes are investigated by optical absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It is found that charge transfer from the nanotube walls to embedded GaSe accompanied by lowering of the Fermi level in nanotubes occurs in the obtained nanocomposite; i.e., acceptor doping of nanotubes takes place.

 Abstract: A new technique for manipulation and control of gradient-driven instabilities through nonlinear interaction with Alfvén waves in a laboratory plasma is presented. A narrow, field-aligned density depletion is created in the Large Plasma Device, resulting in coherent, unstable fluctuations on the periphery of the depletion. Two independent shear Alfvén waves are launched along the depletion at separate frequencies, creating a nonlinear beat-wave response at or near the frequency of the original instability. When the beat wave has sufficient amplitude, the original unstable mode is suppressed, leaving only the beat-wave response, generally at lower amplitude.

 Abstract: In the present work, the channels of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were filled with tin sulfide (SnS), gallium telluride (GaTe), and bismuth selenide (Bi2Se3). The successful encapsulation of the compounds was proven by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. The electronic properties of the filled SWCNTs were studied by optical absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was found that the embedded metal chalcogenides have different influence on the electronic properties of the nanotubes. The incorporation of tin sulfide into the SWCNTs does not result in sufficient changes in the electronic structure of SWCNTs, except for a minor influence on metallic nanotubes. The filling of SWCNTs with gallium telluride causes the charge transfer from the SWCNT walls to the encapsulated compound due to acceptor doping of the nanotubes. The insertion of bismuth selenide inside the SWCNT channels does not lead to the modification of the electronic properties of nanotubes.

 Abstract: There are many examples in which the cavities of carbon nanotubes have been filled with a variety of compounds. Unprecedented structures compared to those of the same material in the bulk are observed, such as low dimensional crystals. Such encapsulated materials can have unusual properties that differ from those of the bulk material. The scope of this review is to give a brief approach to the different nanostructures formed after encapsulation of inorganic compounds within the inner cavities of carbon nanotubes. The confined materials can take the form of one-dimensional nanowires, nanoclusters or even inorganic nanotubes. This review is part of the special issue of the journal dedicated to Prof. Malcolm L.H. Green, and special emphasis is thus given to the work performed by the group of Prof. Green.

 Abstract: Five new Lanthanide(III) complexes of malonic acid (HOOC-CH2-COOH); {[Gd(C3H2O4)(H2O)4]*NO3}_n_ (**1**), {[Tb(C3H2O4)(H2O)4]*NO3}_n_ (**2**), {[Ho(C3H2O4)(H2O)4]*NO3}_n_ (**3**), [Er(C3H2O4)(C3H3O4)(H2O)2]_n_ (**4**), and {[Eu2(C3H2O4)2(C3H3O4)2(H2O)6]*4H2O}_n_ (**5**) were synthesized and characterized by elemental, infrared spectral, and thermal analyses. The structures of compounds **1** -**5** were determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction technique. The X-ray analysis reveals that compounds **1, 2** , and **3** are isostructural and crystallized in the orthorhombic space group _Pmn_ 21. The lanthanide(III) ions are coordinated by four carboxylate and four water oxygen atoms adopting a distorted square antiprism geometry. The LnO8 square antiprisms are linked into infinite layers by malonate (C3H2O42-) dianions sandwiching sheets of nitrate counter ions. Compound **4** contains ErO8 square antiprisms linked into a two-dimensional network by hydrogen malonate (C3H3O4-) anions and malonate dianions. The europium complex, **5** is dinuclear having the two europium(III) ions (Eu1 and Eu2) bridged by carboxylate groups of hydrogen malonate ligands. The europium ions in **5** are nine-coordinate and exhibit a distorted monocapped square antiprism geometry. All the structures are consolidated by O-H⋯ O hydrogen bonds. The photoluminescence spectra of **1 -5** exhibit characteristic emissions in the visible region. The IR spectra and thermal data are consistent with the structural results. The room-temperature effective magnetic moments for **1 -4** are in good agreement with those expected for the free ions, while the data for **5** indicates that low-lying excited states contribute to the observed moment. The compound **1** was further subjected to quantum computational calculations to explore its optoelectronic properties including; density of states (DOS), dielectric function, refractive index, extinction coefficient, and absorption spectrum, to highlight the possible applications of such materials in the optoelectronics.
 

Paper 51: [Encapsulation of Cadmium Selenide Nanocrystals in Biocompatible Nanotubes: DFT Calculations, X‐ray Diffraction Investigations, and Confocal Fluorescence …](https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/open.201700184) (2018, 16 cites)
 Abstract: The encapsulation of CdSe nanocrystals within single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) cavities of varying dimensions at elevated temperatures under strictly air-tight conditions is described for the first time. The structures of CdSe nanocrystals under confinement inside SWNTs were established in a comprehensive study, combining both experimental and DFT theoretical investigations. The calculated binding energies show that all considered polymorphs [(3:3), (4:4), and (4:2)] may be obtained experimentally. The most thermodynamically stable structure (3:3) is directly compared to the experimentally observed CdSe structures inside carbon nanotubes. The gas-phase DFT-calculated energy difference between “free” 3:3 and 4:2 structures (whereby 3:3 models a novel tubular structure in which both Cd and Se form three coordination, as observed experimentally for HgTe inside SWNT, and 4:2 is a motif derived from the hexagonal CuI bulk structure in which both Cd and Se form 4 or 2 coordination) is surprisingly small, only 0.06 eV per formula unit. X-ray powder diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray analyses led to the full characterization of the SWNTs filled with the CdSe nanocrystals, shedding light on the composition, structure, and electronic interactions of the new nanohybrid materials on an atomic level. A new emerging hybrid nanomaterial, simultaneously filled and beta-d-glucan coated, was obtained by using pristine nanotubes and bulk CdSe powder as starting materials. This displayed fluorescence in water dispersions and unexpected biocompatibility was found to be mediated by beta-d-glucan (a biopolymer extracted from barley) with respect to that of the individual inorganic material components. For the first time, such supramolecular nanostructures are investigated by life-science techniques applied to functional nanomaterial characterization, opening the door for future nano-biotechnological applications.

 Abstract: We have investigated the electronic properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) filled with lead chloride, lead bromide (PbBr2) and lead iodide (PbI2). The filling of SWCNTs and formation of encapsulated one-dimensional nanocrystals of the salts were directly confirmed by high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. The chemical composition of the encapsulated nanocrystals was proven by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electronic properties of the filled SWCNTs were characterized by Raman spectroscopy and XPS. All the three lead halogenides result in p-doping of SWCNTs and, consequently, there is a downshift of the SWCNTs’ Fermi level due to the charge transfer towards the salts. The effect is stronger with metallic than semiconducting nanotubes. The efficiency of doping depends on the type of lead halogenide. The doping effect is the strongest for PbI2 and the weakest for PbBr2.

 Abstract: We study vibrational and electronic properties of tin selenide (SnSe) nanowires encapsulated in single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) by combining experimental Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) level. The theoretically investigated standalone SnSe nanowires are Sn4Se4 with square (2 × 2) atomic arrangement and Sn6Se6 with a repeating hexagonal Mo6S6-like structure. Raman data support the theoretical prediction that the square (2 × 2) nanowires possess specific modes at 151 and 185 cm−1, whereas the hexagonal Sn6Se6 structure is characterized by a mode appearing at ~ 235 cm−1. Calculations predict that the (2 × 2) nanowire has an electronic gap of 1.5 eV and the Sn6Se6 nanowire presents a semi-metallic character. Raman spectra of composite SnSe@SWCNT samples show that the radial breathing mode of the nanotubes is strongly suppressed indicating interaction between SWCNT and the encapsulated SnSe nanowire while the Fano asymmetry parameter of the G band is increased.

 Abstract: Atomically thin nanowires (NWs) can be synthesized inside single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and feature unique crystal structures. Here we show that HgTe nanowires formed inside small-diameter (<1 nm) SWCNTs can advantageously alter the optical and electronic properties of the SWCNTs. Metallic purification of the filled SWCNTs was achieved by a gel column chromatography method, leading to an efficient extraction of the semiconducting and metallic portions with known chiralities. Electron microscopic imaging revealed that zigzag HgTe chains were the dominant NW geometry in both the semiconducting and metallic species. Equilibrium-state and ultrafast spectroscopy demonstrated that the coupled electron–phonon system was modified by the encapsulated HgTe NWs, in a way that varied with the chirality. For semiconducting SWCNTs with HgTe NWs, Auger relaxation processes were suppressed, leading to enhanced photoluminescence emission. In contrast, HgTe NWs enhanced the Auger relaxation rate of metallic SWCNTs and created faster phonon relaxation, providing experimental evidence that encapsulated atomic chains can suppress hot carrier effects and therefore boost electronic transport.

 Abstract: This review discusses the phemenology of filling, the investigation of kinetics, and the electronic properties for applications of filled single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), and summarizes five main achievements that were obtained in processing the spectroscopic data of SWCNTs filled with metal halogenide, metal chalcogenide, metal and metallocenes. First, the methods of processing kinetic data were developed to reveal precise trends in growth rates and activation energies of the growth of SWCNTs. Second, the metal-dependence of kinetics was revealed. Third, metallicity-sorted (metallic and semiconducting) SWCNTs were filled with a range of substances and the electronic properties were investigated. Fourth, new approaches to processing the data of spectroscopic investigations of filled SWCNTs were developed, which allowed more reliable and precise analysis of the experimental results. Fifth, the correlation between the physical and chemical properties of encapsulated substances and the electronic properties of SWCNTs were elucidated. These points are highlighted in the review.
 

Paper 66: [Encapsulation of cadmium telluride nanocrystals within single walled carbon nanotubes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020169318317626) (2019, 10 cites)
 Abstract: The encapsulation of crystal structures of cadmium telluride within small diameter single walled nanotubes (SWNTs) are studied using density functional theory with a dispersion correction (DFT + D). Four different suitable pseudo one-dimensional (1-d) CdTe crystals were considered and their energies were compared. The isolated **4:2** crystal (derived from the hexagonal CdTe bulk) was calculated to be the most thermodynamically stable of the four structures. Calculations were performed on the **4:2** crystal inserted into three different SWNTs, (8, 8), (9, 9), and (10, 10), in order to investigate energy of formation of the CdTe@SWNT composites. The calculated encapsulation energies show that the interaction between nanotubes and the CdTe crystals is noncovalent. Since the energy difference of the “free” **4:2** and **3:3** structures is small (0.07 eV/CdTe), we carried out calculations on **3:3** CdTe structure encapsulated in to two different SWNTs, (9, 9) and (10, 10). The calculated binding energies are exoergic suggesting that this polymorph may also be found experimentally. The other two structures are also encapsulated and their results are discussed though they can be found within SWNTs at high temperatures. The present study proposes that both **4:2** and **3:3** CdTe structures can be observed in the microscopic experiments and further experimental verification is required.

 Abstract: The channels of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) were filled with eutectic composition consisting of PbSnF4 and SnF2. The nanocomposite was investigated by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), X-ray energy dispersive (EDX) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The SnF2 and PbSnF4 nanocrystals form independent regions with disordered atomic region between them inside the SWCNT with a diameter of 20.0(3) Å. In the PbSnF4 region there are two separate fragments connected by a twinning plane. Structural models of the PbSnF4 twin nanocrystal and SnF2 nanocrystal inside the nanotube with chilarity (26,0) were constructed and computer modelling of TEM-image of E(PbSnF4;SnF2)@SWCNT nanocomposite was performed. Solid-state FIB with Ce as anode, dispersed E(PbSnF4;SnF2)@SWCNT + SnF2 as a composite-cathode and 95.03%LaF3+4.97%BaF2 electrolyte was investigated by the impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. The current density reached ∼0.6 A/m2 at 180 °C, the open circuit voltage of the pellet at room temperature was 1.9 V.

 Abstract: Here, we present a review of the major achievements in kinetics, electronic properties, and engineering in the Fermi level of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Firstly, the kinetics of metal-filled SWCNTs were revealed with precision over several minutes. Secondly, the growth rates of nanotubes were calculated. Thirdly, the activation energies of nanotubes were measured. Fourthly, the methods of the quantitative analysis of the doping level were developed. Indeed, only qualitative analysis has been previously performed. The quantitative analysis allowed us to obtain quantitative data on charge transfer. Fifthly, the correlation between the physical properties, chemical properties, electronic properties of SWCNTs was elucidated.

Paper 77: [A covalent organic framework membrane with homo hierarchical pores for confined reactive crystallization](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsami.1c21385) (2022, 5 cites)
 Abstract: Gas–liquid (G–L) reactive crystallization is a major technology for advanced materials construction, which requires a short diffusion path on the interface to ensure the reactant supply and stable crystal nucleation under ultrahigh supersaturation. Herein, a covalent organic framework (COF) membrane with homo hierarchical pore structures was proposed as an effective interfacial material for the regulation of confined reactive crystallization. By combining the ordered nanopores of COFs and micropores of anodic aluminum oxide (AAO), the COF membrane simultaneously provided an excellent nanoscale diffusion–reaction regulation network as the molecular-level confined G–L reactive interface and adjustable submicrometer gas mass transfer channels. The highly selective construction of CaCO3 superstructures was then achieved. When the submicrometer primary pore size _r_ p of the constructed COF membrane ranged from 120 to 1.6 nm, the diffusion mechanism of CO2 varied from viscous flow diffusion to Knudsen diffusion. The growth orientation of CaCO3 crystals was well confined to obtain spindle-shaped crystals with high selectivity. Meanwhile, the crystal selectivity factor (cube/sphere) increased from 0 to 3.53 under the low interfacial nuclear barrier. Thus, the COF membrane with coupled micro-nanostructures successfully screened the directional preparation conditions for diverse CaCO3 superstructures, which also paved a meaningful path for the functional application of COFs in accurate mass transfer control and confined chemical reactions.

Paper 79: [Encapsulation and Adsorption of Halogens into Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8023/1/1/11) (2021, 5 cites)
 Abstract: Functionalisation of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) with atoms and molecules has the potential to prepare charge-transfer complexes for numerous applications. Here, we used density functional theory with dispersion correction (DFT + D) to examine the encapsulation and adsorption efficacy of single-walled carbon nanotubes to trap halogens. Our calculations show that encapsulation is exoergic with respect to gas-phase atoms. The stability of atoms inside SWNTs is revealed by the charge transfer between nanotubes and halogens. Encapsulation of halogens in the form of diatomic molecules is favourable with respect to both atoms and diatomic molecules as reference states. The adsorption of halogens on the outer surfaces of SWNTs is also exothermic. In all cases, the degree of encapsulation, adsorption, and charge transfer is reflected by the electronegativity of halogens.

 Abstract: Low-dimensional materials can display enhanced electronic, magnetic, and quantum properties. We use the topological scaling algorithm to identify all sufficiently metastable materials in the Materials Project database to identify bulk crystals with one-dimensional (1D) structural motifs: Five hundred fifty-one crystals that are within 50 meV atom−1 of the thermodynamic hull display 1D motifs, where 293 of these contain d-valence elements, which we focus on in this work. After exfoliating nanowires from 263 of these materials and calculating their thermodynamic stability using density functional theory, 103 nanowires meet per-atom and per-Ångström thermodynamic stability criteria. We illustrate for three nanowire systems that a variety of local minima can be present in these systems, demonstrating one case of a Peierls distortion. The wires display a broad diversity of electronic and magnetic properties of these nanowires, with 14 metals, 7 half-metals, and 82 semiconductors and insulators, and 41 nanowires displaying magnetic moments ranging from 0.1 to 5μB per d-valence species when assuming ferromagnetic order. A subset of these chains are investigated for the impact of magnetic ordering, identifying 1D FeCl3 to be most stable in an antiferromagnetic state. The electronic and magnetic properties of the identified 1D materials could enable applications in spintronic and quantum devices.
