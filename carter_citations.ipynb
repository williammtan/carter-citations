Here, the influence of confinement on crystallization processes is described, drawing together information from fields as diverse as bioinspired mineralization, templating, pharmaceuticals, colloidal crystallization, and geochemistry. Experiments are principally conducted within confining systems that offer well-defined environments, varying from droplets in microfluidic devices, to cylindrical pores in filtration membranes, to nanoporous glasses and carbon nanotubes. Dramatic effects are observed, including a stabilization of metastable polymorphs, a depression of freezing points, and the formation of crystals with preferred orientations, modified morphologies, and even structures not seen in bulk. Confinement is also shown to influence crystallization processes over length scales ranging from the atomic to hundreds of micrometers, and to originate from a wide range of mechanisms. The development of an enhanced understanding of the influence of confinement on crystal nucleation and growth will not only provide superior insight into crystallization processes in many real-world environments, but will also enable this phenomenon to be used to control crystallization in applications including nanomaterial synthesis, heavy metal remediation, and the prevention of weathering.'}\n",

The concept of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure, which has gained great success in superlattice of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, can be also extended to heterostructures with 1D atomic crystals. Due to the less rigid requirement on lattice matching, versatility of foreign materials with different dimensionalities can be integrated with the 1D templates via non-covalent bonding. Such 1D vdW heterostructures are expected to exhibit intriguing physical properties and functionalities that cannot be realized in single-component 1D material. This review article aims to provide a succinct and critical survey of the emerging 1D vdW heterostructures. We start with an overview of the configuration and summarize the synthetic strategies of 1D vdW heterostructures. Next, we discuss their physical properties with emphasis on those originated from the unique structure–property relationship, including spatial confinement effect and phase transition, band structure and electrical properties, optical properties, thermal properties and environmental stability, and directional mass transport. The emerging applications of 1D vdW heterostructures in electronic, photonic, optoelectronic and energy storage fields are comprehensively overviewed.

These are global challenges, and their resolution is vital to our energy security. Although many conventional materials, such as metals, ceramics, and plastics, cannot fulfil all requirements for these new technologies, many material combinations can offer synergistic effects that create improved and even new properties. The implementation of nanocarbons, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes, into nanocomposites and, more recently, into the new class of hybrids, are very promising examples. In contrast to classical nanocomposites, where a low volume fraction of the carbon component is mixed into a polymer or ceramic matrix, hybrids are materials in which nanocarbon is coated with a thin layer of the functional compound, which introduces the interface as a powerful new parameter. Based on interfacial charge and energy transfer processes, nanocarbon hybrids have shown increased sensitivities in gas sensors, improved efficiencies in photovoltaics, superior activities in photocatalysts, and enhanced capacities in supercapacitors. This review compares the characteristics and potentials of both nanocarbon composites and hybrids, highlights recent developments in their synthesis and discusses key challenges for their use in various energy applications.'}\n",

With atom-wide motifs repeated in one dimension (1D), they offer a privileged perspective into the physics and chemistry of low-dimensional systems. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) provide ideal environments for the creation of such materials. Here we present a comprehensive study of Te ENs encapsulated inside ultranarrow SWCNTs with diameters between 0.7 nm and 1.1 nm. We combine state-of-the-art imaging techniques and 1D-adapted ab initio structure prediction to treat both confinement and periodicity effects. The studied Te ENs adopt a variety of structures, exhibiting a true 1D realization of a Peierls structural distortion and transition from metallic to insulating behavior as a function of encapsulating diameter. We analyze the mechanical stability of the encapsulated ENs and show that nanoconfinement is not only a useful means to produce ENs but also may actually be necessary, in some cases, to prevent them from disintegrating. The ability to control functional properties of these ENs with confinement has numerous applications in future device technologies, and we anticipate that our study will set the basic paradigm to be adopted in the characterization and understanding of such systems.'}\n",

Here we show that HgTe nanowires formed inside small-diameter (<1 nm) SWCNTs can advantageously alter the optical and electronic properties of the SWCNTs. Metallic purification of the filled SWCNTs was achieved by a gel column chromatography method, leading to an efficient extraction of the semiconducting and metallic portions with known chiralities. Electron microscopic imaging revealed that zigzag HgTe chains were the dominant NW geometry in both the semiconducting and metallic species. Equilibrium-state and ultrafast spectroscopy demonstrated that the coupled electron–phonon system was modified by the encapsulated HgTe NWs, in a way that varied with the chirality. For semiconducting SWCNTs with HgTe NWs, Auger relaxation processes were suppressed, leading to enhanced photoluminescence emission. In contrast, HgTe NWs enhanced the Auger relaxation rate of metallic SWCNTs and created faster phonon relaxation, providing experimental evidence that encapsulated atomic chains can suppress hot carrier effects and therefore boost electronic transport.'}\n",

Successfully employed in commercial optical data storage products, phase-change materials, that can reversibly and rapidly change from an amorphous phase to a crystalline phase when subject to heating or cooling have been identified for the development of the next generation electronic memories. There are limitations to the miniaturization of these devices due to current synthesis and theoretical considerations that place a lower limit of 2 nm on the minimum bit size, below which the material does not transform in the structural phase. We show here that by using carbon nanotubes of less than 2 nm diameter as templates phase-change nanowires confined to their smallest conceivable scale are obtained. Contrary to previous experimental evidence and theoretical expectations, the nanowires are found to crystallize at this scale and display amorphous-to-crystalline phase changes, fulfilling an important prerequisite of a memory element. We show evidence for the smallest phase-change material, extending thus the size limit to explore phase-change memory devices at extreme scales.'}\n",

            "{'abstract': 'In present work, thulium chloride, gallium selenide, bismuth telluride, and silver were encapsulated into the channels of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). The structural properties of obtained nanostructures were studied by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and the modification of electronic properties of nanotubes as result of filling their channels with chosen substances was investigated by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was shown that the electronic properties of filled SWCNTs depend on the chemical nature of incorporated materials. The encapsulation of TmCl3 and GaSe into the carbon nanotube channels leads to acceptor doping of the SWCNTs, and this effect is more prominent for thulium chloride. The incorporation of bismuth telluride into the nanotube cavities does not result in any modification of their electronic properties. The filling of the nanotube channels with silver leads to donor doping of the single-walled carbon nanotubes.'}\n",

            "{'abstract': 'The prospective of nitrogen doped graphene (NDG) as useful nonlinear optical (NLO) and charge transport materials is explored using first principles methods. A dual methodological strategy is adopted by performing molecular level and bulk level calculations through first principles methods. The calculated molecular geometry and absorption wavelengths are found to be in reasonable agreement with experimental results of parent NDG compound **1** (di-peri-(tert-butylbenzo)-di-peri-(tri-methoxybenzo)-di-peri-(pyrimidino)-coronene). Similarly, first principles calculations of the solid-state crystal structure show that NDG compound **1** retains a value of 1.585 eV as its direct band gap, which is potentially useful for a direct bad gap semiconductor for optical device applications. The calculation of second- (β) and third-order (γ) nonlinear optical properties indicates that compound **1** possesses reasonably large values of βtot (22.96 × 10−30 esu) and 〈γ〉 (238.53 × 10−36 esu) amplitudes, which may fall well within the figure of merit for second harmonic generation (SHG) and two-photon absorption (TPA) applications, etc. TD-DFT calculations along with the plots of the frontier molecular orbitals show an intramolecular charge transfer from the rest of the graphene fragment to the pyridine moieties (N-doped sites) accompanied by significant oscillator strengths for involved transitions in the absorption spectra. Additionally, several key optical parameters (dielectric and conductivity functions, refractive index and extinction coefficients) are calculated to assess the overall optical efficiency of parent NDG compound **1**. The present investigation not only features the substantial potential of NDG compound **1** as an efficient optical material but also highlights the importance of the substitution of its terminal groups to enhance the first- and second hyperpolarizability amplitudes, as exemplified through the design of compound **3**.'}\n",

The influence of incorporated chemical compounds on the electronic properties of the carbon nanotubes was investigated by optical absorption spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, near edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It was found that there is the chemical bonding between carbon atoms of nanotube walls and metal atoms of encapsulated CdX2 nanocrystals. The obtained data testify acceptor doping effect of cadmium halogenides incorporated into the SWCNT channels, which is accompanied by the charge transfer from nanotube walls to introduced substances.'}\n",

            "{'abstract': 'We present a facile wet-chemistry method for efficient metal filling of the hollow inner cores of boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs). The fillers conform to the cross-section of the tube cavity and extend in length from a few nm to hundreds of nm. The methodology is robust and is demonstrated for noble metals (Au, Pt, Pd, and Ag), transition metals (Co), and post-transition elements (In). Transmission electron microscopy and related electron spectroscopy confirm the composition and morphology of the filler nanoparticles. Up to 60% of BNNTs of a given preparation batch have some degree of metal encapsulation, and individual tubes can have up to 10% of their core volume filled during initial loading. The growth, movement, and fusing of metal nanoparticles within the BNNTs are also examined.'}\n",

            "{'abstract': 'In common with rocksalt-type alkali halide phases and also semiconductors such as GeTe and SnTe, SnSe forms all-surface two atom-thick low dimensional crystals when encapsulated within single walled nanotubes (SWNTs) with diameters below ∼1.4 nm. Whereas previous density functional theory (DFT) studies indicate that optimised low-dimensional trigonal HgTe changes from a semi-metal to a semi-conductor, low-dimensional SnSe crystals typically undergo band-gap expansion. In slightly wider diameter SWNTs (∼1.4–1.6 nm), we observe that three atom thick low dimensional SnSe crystals undergo a previously unobserved form of a shear inversion phase change resulting in two discrete strain states in a section of curved nanotube. Under low-voltage (i.e. 80–100 kV) imaging conditions in a transmission electron microscope, encapsulated SnSe crystals undergo longitudinal and rotational oscillations, possibly as a result of the increase in the inelastic scattering cross-section of the sample at those voltages.'}\n",

Unprecedented structures compared to those of the same material in the bulk are observed, such as low dimensional crystals. Such encapsulated materials can have unusual properties that differ from those of the bulk material. The scope of this review is to give a brief approach to the different nanostructures formed after encapsulation of inorganic compounds within the inner cavities of carbon nanotubes. The confined materials can take the form of one-dimensional nanowires, nanoclusters or even inorganic nanotubes. This review is part of the special issue of the journal dedicated to Prof. Malcolm L.H. Green, and special emphasis is thus given to the work performed by the group of Prof. Green.'}\n",

            "{'abstract': 'The imaging properties and observation of the sterically regulated translational motion of discrete tungsten polyoxometalate Lindqvist ions (i.e., [W6O19]2−) within carbon nanotubes of specific internal diameter are reported. The translational motion of the nonspheroidal anion within the nanotube capillary is found to be impeded by its near-perfect accommodation to the internal van der Waals surface of the nanotube wall. Rotational motion of the anion about one remaining degree of freedom permits translational motion of the anion along the nanotube followed by locking in at sterically favorable positions in a mechanism similar to a molecular ratchet. This steric locking permits the successful direct imaging of the constituent octahedral cation template of individual [W6O19]2− anions by high resolution transmission electron microscopy thereby permitting metrological measurements to be performed directly on the anion. Direct imaging of pairs of equatorial W2 atoms within the anion reveal steric relaxation of the anion contained within the nanotube capillary relative to the bulk anion structure.'}\n",

            "{'abstract': 'Crystalline ErCl3 nanowires have been fabricated in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with high yield (∼90%), and the structural and magnetic properties of the resulting ErCl3 nanowires encapsulated in SWCNTs (ErCl3@SWCNTs) characterized. Encapsulation under high temperature and vacuum using high quality SWCNTs results in a high filling-ratio of ErCl3 nanowires in the SWCNTs. The high filling-ratio of ErCl3 nanowires and the use of highly pure SWCNTs with only a small amount of residual Fe catalyst nanoparticles enabled us to observe the magnetic properties of ErCl3@SWCNTs. Structure determination based on simulated annealing calculations and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) image simulations revealed that the structure of the ErCl3 nanowires is unusual with respect to the coordination environment of the Eu3+ ions. This work opens up new possibilities to fabricate various metal complex nanowires with high yield and may also be of more general importance in understanding and exploring magnetic properties in low-dimensional magnetic systems.'}\n",

            "{'abstract': 'We have investigated the electronic properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) filled with lead chloride, lead bromide (PbBr2) and lead iodide (PbI2). The filling of SWCNTs and formation of encapsulated one-dimensional nanocrystals of the salts were directly confirmed by high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. The chemical composition of the encapsulated nanocrystals was proven by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The electronic properties of the filled SWCNTs were characterized by Raman spectroscopy and XPS. All the three lead halogenides result in p-doping of SWCNTs and, consequently, there is a downshift of the SWCNTs’ Fermi level due to the charge transfer towards the salts. The effect is stronger with metallic than semiconducting nanotubes. The efficiency of doping depends on the type of lead halogenide. The doping effect is the strongest for PbI2 and the weakest for PbBr2.'}\n",

            "{'abstract': 'Gas–liquid (G–L) reactive crystallization is a major technology for advanced materials construction, which requires a short diffusion path on the interface to ensure the reactant supply and stable crystal nucleation under ultrahigh supersaturation. Herein, a covalent organic framework (COF) membrane with homo hierarchical pore structures was proposed as an effective interfacial material for the regulation of confined reactive crystallization. By combining the ordered nanopores of COFs and micropores of anodic aluminum oxide (AAO), the COF membrane simultaneously provided an excellent nanoscale diffusion–reaction regulation network as the molecular-level confined G–L reactive interface and adjustable submicrometer gas mass transfer channels. The highly selective construction of CaCO3 superstructures was then achieved. When the submicrometer primary pore size _r_ p of the constructed COF membrane ranged from 120 to 1.6 nm, the diffusion mechanism of CO2 varied from viscous flow diffusion to Knudsen diffusion. The growth orientation of CaCO3 crystals was well confined to obtain spindle-shaped crystals with high selectivity. Meanwhile, the crystal selectivity factor (cube/sphere) increased from 0 to 3.53 under the low interfacial nuclear barrier. Thus, the COF membrane with coupled micro-nanostructures successfully screened the directional preparation conditions for diverse CaCO3 superstructures, which also paved a meaningful path for the functional application of COFs in accurate mass transfer control and confined chemical reactions.'}\n",

            "{'abstract': 'Since the discovery of metals encapsulated into multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), such sheathed structures attracted extensive interest with respect to the development of various synthetic strategies for producing the unique structure of nanowires sheathed inside nanotubes. The nanowire materials varied from metals to alloys, from semiconductors to insulators, and even metal–semiconductor heterojunctions were tried. In recent years, the studies on these nanostructures have been mainly focused on in-situ manipulation, property analysis and applications. Exploration of on-demand nano-engineering of the regarded structures toward practical device design and fabrication was mainly guided by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique combining new capabilities of implementation of atomic force (AFM) or scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) holders, and heating/cooling holders. Such novel in-situ TEM techniques have rapidly developed to a stage where they truly become a very powerful tool for the studies of core/shell nanowire heterostructures. In this review, we summarize the significant developments and achievements in regards of manipulation, property measurements and device applications of inorganic nanowires sheathed inside nanotubes according to different categories of the filling materials, i.e., metals, alloys, compounds and semiconductor–metal heterojunction nanowires. We also highlight the irreplaceable value of in-situ TEM technology in this field, compare different fillings for so-called nanothermometers, discuss mass transportation mechanism in nanotubes, and conclude with an outlook of future developments and challenging issues that are still in the premature stage.'}\n",
